<p>AI-based and data-driven solutions for software vulnerability analytics are being increasingly accepted by industry. Snyk, one of the biggest security vendors, uses an AI engine for their source code analysis tool.</p>

<p>However, data and information quality serves as a major limiting barrier to any data-driven approach. Reliance on software vulnerability reporting practices leads to weak label indicators and poor data quality.</p>

<p>In this project, we analyse the data quality of software vulnerability information sources, and provide robust methods to overcome such challenges.</p>
