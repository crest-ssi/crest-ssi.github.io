# Overview

Modern software engineering paradigms embrace 'shift left' ideology; shift the security consideration to as early as possible in the development lifecycle. After all, proactive prevention is significantly cheaper than reactive fixing and patching.

However, developing secure code is no easy task. We enable this transition through intelligent data-driven tool support, that operates 'just-in-time' before vulnerabilities would enter a codebase.
