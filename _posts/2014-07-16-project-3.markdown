# Overview

Developer-centric security aims to empower developers to be capable of individually achieving an organisation's security goals. At the base, developers need adequate security knowledge and awareness to achieve such aims.   

However, in the modern software security landscape, a secure software developer is required to know and memorize thousands of security weaknesses and patterns to defend against, and this list of required knowledge is growing every day. Developers cannot keep up with the abundance of security information that they need to process.  

In this project, we provide tools and services to automatically disseminate large-scale security knowledge from open sources.
