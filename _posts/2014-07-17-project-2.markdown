description: Analysis and assessment of data quality for software vulnerability data sets and sources.

# Overview
AI-based and data-driven solutions for software vulnerability analytics are being increasingly accepted by industry. Snyk, one of the biggest security vendors, uses an AI engine for their source code analysis tool.   

However, data and information quality serves as a major limiting barrier to any data-driven approach. Reliance on software vulnerability reporting practices leads to weak label indicators and poor data quality.  

In this project, we analyse the data quality of software vulnerability information sources, and provide robust methods to overcome such challenges.
