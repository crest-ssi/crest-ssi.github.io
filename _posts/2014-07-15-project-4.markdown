# Overview

Containers become increasingly popular as a virtualization technology to build softwarized infrastructures. A container includes an application and its dependencies such as code, libraries, and configuration files to support a target application. Thus, containers promote modularity and reproducibility, two of the reasons for making containers popular.

Security is a critical consideration while adopting containerization. Several survey results among software professionals indicated security as the top-concern in establishing a reliable container environment. 

In this project, we leverage various automated approaches to develop tools and techniques to better understand the developersâ€™ viewpoint on security while adopting container technologies. We study a large volume of container-related data in open source software repositories (GitHub), Question/Answering Platforms (Stack Overflow, Docker Forum) as well as container image repositories (Docker Hub) to find and analyse the security issues. 

This research will help container developers and researchers to understand container security requirements, provide a broad view of possible security attacks and their countermeasures.
